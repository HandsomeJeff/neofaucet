# NEO Faucet

This project is aimed to create a scailable system to distribute Testnet GAS for developers and enthusiasts to create test smart contracts. Using your Github account you can request up to 5,000 Testnet NEO/GAS per day. We will send the requested amount of funds to a [multisignature address](https://github.com/neo-project/docs/blob/master/en-us/network/testnet.md#method-of-getting-test-gas-and-test-neo) where it can be withdrawn to a personal wallet. 

> *Development on the Testnet should always be the last testing phase or for a way to interact with the public, use a [Privatenet](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/network/private-chain.html) for the early stages*
